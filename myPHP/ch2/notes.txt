I. Using MySQL
    MySQL: Very identical to MySQL
        INSERT INTO users VALUES('Smith', 'John', 'jsmith@mysite.com');

        SELECT surname,firstname FROM users WHERE email='jsmith@mysite.com';

    (!) With PHP, you can make these calls directly to MySQL  without having 
    to access MySQL command-line interface.

        - You can save results in array for processing and perform multiple lookups.

II. Using JavaScript
    w/ html
        * provides dynamic user interaction
            - checking email address validity in input forms
            - displaying prompts.
            - dynammic control over eleemnts in HTML
    w/ css
        * helps create dynamic web pages 
            - changing fonts when in a new page.
        
    Used for asynchronous communication:
        - process of accessing the web server in the background.
            - No need to be reloaded to display new content.
        - Asynchronous call can update a single element on a webpage.
